\section{Motivation}
Every time requires it's own heroes. Nowadays, with a massive digitalization of the world, statistical analysis is not only used in spheres like classical production and distribution (logistics), but also everywhere on the web. On-line shops requires an analysis of a customer's behavior, specific demands and preferences to create a nice web-site, that will attract buyers and more important will make them purchase special goods on a certain site. Another application of data analysis is, of course, video games. The AI used in many game-projects from simple browser-strategy to "most expected of the year" is built on immense data source and its constantly analyzing the incoming data from the players, servers and third party sources (if needed). The game play, the enemy, the load distribution on the servers and many other things are based on statistics and forecast. The are many-many other examples where data analysis is used.\vspace{3mm}\\
Since the computer technologies are way more advanced, than they were several decades ago, the computations can be automatized, the data collection can be automatized. For that purposes certain tools, languages and libraries should be chosen. On the whole, almost every language can be used to build a program for collecting, processing and visualizing data, like: SCALA, C, C++, .NET, Java, Python, JavaScript, R, etc.. However, some of the languages are more suitable for some purposes.\vspace{3mm}\\
In this work we will compare Python 3 language with R language. Both of them are relatively new \textcolor{blue}{(How old are they)} to the wide publicity. Both are used for data analysis (and not only, but this aspect interests us the most). Both languages are widely used for open source projects and have a large community behind them. Also very important that the learning curve for both languages is Exponential \textcolor{blue}{(is it so?)}.
