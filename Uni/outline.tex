\subsection{An overview of the existing approaches, models and programs}
classical econometric - regressions\\
Among the classical econometric approaches two main directions can be called: linear and non-linear regressions. First of all we will consider linear regressions and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.\\
According to the most common definition, in statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and explanatory variable denoted X [1]. There are one-variable regressions called simple linear regressions and multiple regressions, which shows the dependencies of the dependent variable from more than one explanatory variables. The regression equation looks following way:\\
\[Y = a + bX + \varepsilon\]
where Y - dependent variable, X - explanatory variable, a - the intercept of regression line, b - the slope of the regression line, $\varepsilon$ - the error term.\\
The simple linear regression is based on 6 strict assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Because of the linear form neither parameter a, nor parameter b may have higher power than one.
	\item The independent variable X is not random.
	\item The variance is constant. Which means that the expected error value is 0.
	\item The variance of $\varepsilon$ is constant for all observations.
	\item Errors are not correlated.
	\item The error's distribution is normal.
\end{enumerate}
On one hand the simple linear regression has several disadvantages: the form of the equation (here number of the predicting variables is concerned) and underlying assumptions. The dependency from only one variable can not describe fully all the relationship on the market. Even if you consider an equations system, consisting from linear regressions with different variables, it will lead to unnecessary complexity and not realistic or complete dependencies between variables. The second disadvantage is the assumptions - they are unrealistic in modern world and are appropriate only for very simplified model of he world.\\
The big advantage of the simple linear regression on the other hand is it's estimators: ordinary lest squares, generalized least squares, instrumental variables, maximum likelihood (ML) and various ML techniques - these are the most known and not too complex approaches to estimate the regression. There also many other different techniques, but we won't discuss them here. An example of a simple linear regression could be dependency between the harvest volume and amount of rain during the season. Let's say Y = amount of harvest (potato for example) in kg and X is amount of the precipitation in mm\\ Than the more rain will drop during the season the bigger amount of potato will be harvested at the end. The slope of the regression line is positive. And the intercept is also more than 0, because you can't dig out less, than you have planted. So, the regression will look like:
\[amount \thinspace of \thinspace harvest = |a| + |b|*amount \thinspace of \thinspace rain \epsilon\] \\
Since it is likely to be impossible to build a proper prediction for the variable only with one predicting variable, multiple linear regression was invented. As you can see from the name, multiple linear regression describes relationship between more than one explanatory variables and dependent variable. The form of the equation looks as following:\[ Y = a + b_{1}X_{1}+ ... + b_{n}X_{n} + \epsilon, \thinspace \thinspace where \thinspace \thinspace n \in N\]   
$b_{i}$ - the "contribution" of the i-th variable to the regression, a -the intercept of the regression line, Y - dependant variable, X - explanatory variables.\\
Unlike simple linear regression, multiple linear regression does not have the form-disadvantage. However, the linear nature of the regression provides the model with several assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item All $b_{i}$ have the power of 1 - linear dependency between Y and all Xi-th.
	\item The residuals are distributed normally. (Residuals - the difference between predicted value and observed value).
	\item Uncertain number of the explanatory variables X - there is no technique to choose exact number of the variables that will optimally predict the value Y.
	\item Completely "substitutive" variables X - unnecessary big number of the variables without increasing the accuracy of the prediction.
	\item Complex form of the variables (X can have a higher-order polynomial form) leads to reduction of transparency and wrong results. 
\end{enumerate}
The advantage of the multiple linear regression is that it can be tested several ways. First, you can test whether the regression has the linear character by using F-test or ANOVA table. Second, to check whether the model is good enough you can use the same tests as for simple linear regression: determination coefficient $R^2$. You can also run several hypothesis-test for each explanatory variable ($b_{i}$ coefficient is equal to 0 - the variable is insignificant).\\
As an example of the multiple linear regression we can take previous example and extend it. The amount of the precipitation is not the only factor for the harvest to grow. Our Y variable also depends on amount of sunny days ($X_{2}$) and average temperature during the season ($X_{3}$). The higher temperature, the better will be the harvest (in reality this is a non linear dependency; most likely the dependency here takes the form of $(c-d*\sqrt{x})$: the harvest will be big, if the temperature is between certain degrees). The higher number of the sunny days the less rainy days, but higher the temperature. This is an example where two explanatory variables are not complete substitutes, but they have negative dependency with each other, so, their dependency will be explicitly included into the regression. The general form of the equation will take following form:
\[harvest = |a| + |b_{1}|*rain + |b_{2}|*sun + |b_{3}|*temperature + |b_{12}|*sun*rain + \epsilon\]
So the multiple linear regression is better for real purposes (real market analysis) in comparison to simple linear regression, but it still contains restrictions that do not allow high accuracy prediction.\\
Unfortunately linear dependencies between all the parameters and variables in the equation is a rare thing in the real life. That is why nonlinear regressions took place in statistical analysis. The general form of the nonlinear regression looks as following:
\[Y = f(\beta, x'_{i}) + \epsilon'\]
where f() - nonlinear function, $x'_{i}$ - vector of predictors, $\epsilon'$ - vector of parameters, $\epsilon_{i} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$.\\
Nonlinear regressions can be divided into two main classes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Nonlinear dependencies between explanatory variables ($x_{i}$) and dependent variable (Y), linear character of the parameters ($\beta$).
	\item Linear dependencies between explanatory variables ($x_{i}$) and dependent variable (Y), nonlinear character or the parameters ($\beta$) 
\end{enumerate} 
The first class is relatively easy to work with: you can use variables substitution and transform the original equation to the linear form; than use the same techniques as for the linear multiple regression and find estimates for the parameters. For example, you can use least squares method with additional steps. To use LS method you will first need to change the form of the variables to the linear form: $z_{i}$ = $f^{-1}(x_{i})$, where z is a new variable in a linear form. The equation will then take following form: $y=a+b_{1}z_{1}+...b_{n}z_{n}$. As the next step your find the estimates using LS method. However, the estimates will be biased towards original dependencies, because we found them for variables $z_{i}$, which are the transformation of the original variables [non linear j]. So you need to do the last transformation of the estimates for original variables $x_{i}$.\\
The second class is more difficult to use. Because of the nonlinear nature of the parameters you can not use normal estimation techniques. On one hand you can use the ordinary optimum finding algorithms, but you will run into different difficulties because of the character of the dependencies. There are exist different approaches to get the estimates for the regressions: Gauss-Newton method [nonlinear m],  Levenberg-Marquardt method [nonlinear n] (we will not concentrate on these approaches in our work, for further information you can read sources from reference-list). \textcolor{blue}{You can also iteratively try to use LS method (iterative transformations), but with each iteration the estimates will get additional error, which can result in immense accuracy decrease}. \\
As an example for a nonlinear regression we can take the earlier described dependency between harvest volume, amount of rain, number of sunny days and temperature.
\[harvest = a + b_{1}*ln(sun) + b_{2}*(c-d*(rain-e)^2) +b_{3}*f(temperature) + b_{12}*g(sun, rain)\]
where $f(n) = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
  	0,\thinspace x < 10 \\
    \alpha x, \thinspace x \in [10, 30] and \alpha > 1 \\
    -\alpha x,\thinspace x > 30
  \end{array} \right.$ ; c, d and e $>$ 0, $b_{i}$ - reggresion coefficients here they are first-order parameters. \\
As you can see,the normal approach here is is almost impossible to use, moreover, here we see different form of dependencies at one time (normally people use uniform functions like polynomials, logarithms etc.) But this equation can be transformed into linear form via several steps of the variables substitution and transformations, then the LS will be found and the process of "backwards transformation" will be started, until we get the estimates for the original variables.

neural networks\\
The biggest disadvantage of the classical regression models on one hand  is increasing complexity when using too many variables and parameters. Also, they are not flexible enough for a quickly changing and constantly growing and changing financial markets. On the other hand, when using too few parameters and variables the model looses a lot of information and flexibility. Too overcome these problems neural networks are used to make predictions and analyse the increasing amount of data. According to Wikipedia:"In machine learning, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a family of statistical learning algorithms inspired by biological neural networks (the central nervous systems of animals, in particular the brain) and are used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs and are generally unknown. Artificial neural networks are generally presented as systems of interconnected "neurons" which can compute values from inputs, and are capable of machine learning as well as pattern recognition thanks to their adaptive nature" [ANN a]. The ANNs ae used in different spheres where pattern recognition can be used. Only the use of NNs on financial markets is relevant for this work, so we will only consider appropriate forms of the networks and learning-mechanisms.\\
The basic structure of the ANN consists of 3 layers: input, hidden and output layer. As follows from the name, the bottom layer is a input layer, that sends all the data (in our case prices, time series) to the next level via "synopses". Synopses in ANNs are the dependencies between input units and the units of the hidden layer (a weight-function). For example,
\[y_{j} = \sum_{i \in I}w_{ij}x_{i} \]
where $y_{j}$ - an unit in the hidden layer, $w_{ij}$ -weight for input unit i in jth hidden unit (influence if the input node on the hidden node), and $x_{i}$ - input unit.\\
Next dependeny-level is the transformation the hidden layers into output. (This dependency might look the same as the previous one). As an example of the model following form can be used:
\[z=f(y)\]
where z - an output unit, $f$ - a function that transforms all hidden units $y_{j}$ into the output ($y_{j}$ is equals to the sum of the weighted input units, see above), here y is a vector of $y_{j}$, $y=(y_{1},...,y_{n})$.

Choosing the model. ANN is an overkill for the hypothesis but can be used in next step.\\
The idea: "how to check the hypothesis" - in several logical steps.

\section{The model}
\subsection{Data preparation}
Here independent of the main index (not chosen yet) based on correlation-matrices certain amount of indexes will be taken for further consideration. For example every index with correlation-vector bigger or equal to +-0.3\\
Some period of the time-series (for all indexes) will be left as test-sample. (let's say about a month-period).\\
All time series will be cleaned from the noise using following technics: mooving average, extracting a trend line on high frequency long-term data, 
\subsection{Model specification and limitations}
First, the equation or the model description will be given, then the number for the parameters will be set (with all necessary explanations).\\
Second, the automatic optimum finding for given limitations will be maid. (python iterative optimum-finding test). At the end another target function, built from the found optimum will be tested (error check).\\
Third, texts for the chosen indexes will be analysed. The forecast, probability and maybe buzz will be the results of the sub-chapter.\\
Forth, the results of the previous stage will be united into one forecast and probability for the main index (index on the left side of the main equation).\\
Finally, the results of the model will be compared with the actual results that we left as the test-sample.
